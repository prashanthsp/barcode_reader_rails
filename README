== Welcome to the Barcode Reader Web Application
================================================================================================

This is web application allows users to upload images of barcodes to the web server.
Once received, the web applicatin will process the barcode image, scanning it with an external
barcode reader application called ZBar.

Primarily, this web system is used in conjunction with the barcode reader J2ME reader
application. Repository can be viewed at: http://github.com/RedTeamCOSC470/barcode_reader_mobile

Mobile device and web server interaction process:
	- Take an image of a barcode with a mobile device (i.e. Nokia N97).
	- Send the image to the web server as a stream of bytes in a HTTP POST request.
	- Web server re-creates the image as a temporary file.
	- Web server performs image recognition/processing.
	- If the web server is successful in scanning the barcode value from the image, then will
	  save the image permanently on the web server locally and saves barcode information to
	  the database.
	- Web server re-directs to a page with the barcode information or an error message if it was
	  unsuccessful in reading the image.
	- Mobile device's application reads the information and displays it to the user.
To implement (optional):
	- Web server looks up barcode on the internet and finds product information
	- Web server sends product information back to mobile device
